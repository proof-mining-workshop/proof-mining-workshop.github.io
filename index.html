<h1>
Second Workshop on Proof Mining (WPM26)<br> University of Bath, 7&ndash;9 September 2026
</h1>

 <p>
 This is the second instance of a series of workshops dedicated to providing opportunities for people from the diverse areas connected to proof mining to meet, present work in progress, and exchange ideas and knowledge. The meeting will be interdiscplinary in nature, with a particular focus on </p>

<ul>
  <li>logical aspects of proof mining, including proof interpretations and logical systems,</li>
  <li>applications to different areas of mainstream mathematics, including fixed point theory, monotone operator theory, ergodic theory, number theory and probability theory,</li>
  <li>the use of proof assistants to formalise and potentially automate aspects of proof mining.</li>
</ul>

Venue
</h2>

<p>
The main campus of the University of Bath is located on a hilltop just outside the city centre. It is within walking distance from Bath Spa train station in principle, but you should allow 30&ndash;40 minutes and be wary that the route involves a steep uphill climb. A more comfortable alternative is to take one of the regular bus connections from the city centre to the campus. Further information on how to get to the university can be found <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/topics/travel-advice/">here</a>, with details of bus routes <a href="https://www.bath.ac.uk/guides/travelling-by-bus-to-the-university-of-bath/">here</a>.
